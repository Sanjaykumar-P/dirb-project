# dirb-project
Hiii i have started the soc analyst learning so i have studied the dirb command so today i have done the direcorty brute forcing to find the false login in the websites to hack it.



Description:

First i have learned the command like dirb it means directory bruteforcing it use the worlists command list by using that it will specifically search the false login that are in the webiste by using this we can able to identify the logins.
First i used the AI to create the code and i run the cloud servers in the aws and i installed the apache server in that default directory is the cd /var/www/html/index.html ,/admin ,/api/ , /config /old-login like i created after that i enabled the firewall status and i have chnaged the execute permissions for this directory so then after this i have ran the website and in the linux terminal use the command dirb http://13.110.*** this is the ip assigned by cloud aws so run these it should given the directory what are all availabe note down that it should available for only the http websites for the https in later section we will see how to do that. Thankyou
